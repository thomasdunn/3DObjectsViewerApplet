3D Objects Viewer Applet
========================

Java Applet implementing basic 3D primitives and loading 3D file formats with simple shading, rotation, and wireframing.  I wrote this after taking a computer graphics course.

Setup
-----

Install JDK 1.3:
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase13-419413.html

Running
-------

Applets no longer run in modern browsers.  You can still run this via the appletviewer tool which was still available as of JDK 1.3.

To run:
C:\jdk1.3.1_28\bin\appletviewer.exe run.html
